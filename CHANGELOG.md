## [1.3.0] - 2025-08-14
### üéØ New: Summaries
- Weekly and Rolling 4-week summaries from your SQLite data.
- Shows total distance & time, average pace, average power, and average HR.
- Clean formatting, sensible defaults, and timezone-aware date windows.

### Fixes & polish
- Prevented bad `avg_power` values from crashing summaries (legacy rows are coerced to numeric).
- Unified add/import prompts behave consistently for single and batch.
- `find-unparsed` closes its DB connection cleanly.- Safer error messages in single add (no undefined variable references).

### Upgrade notes
If you inserted single runs on v1.2.x, you may have string values in `runs.avg_power`. Run:
```sql
UPDATE runs
SET avg_power = NULL
WHERE typeof(avg_power)='text' OR avg_power GLOB '*:*';
```
